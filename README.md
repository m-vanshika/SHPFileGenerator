# SHP-File-Generator
This is a QGIS plugin that uses Canny algorithm and then U-Net in a machine learning model to detect boundaries in an image or tiff file. The output is then stored in an shp file.

Demonstration of Plugin:

Steps to use the plugin:

  1.Install and start the plugin in QGIS

2. Select the Image of tiff layer whose boundaries are to be detected and also define the output file location.

3. Click on Create SHP layer button and in some time the SHP layer of the boundary will be generated.

[Note: The ML model used is not very efficient yet, we are working to improvise the algorithm used]
